# Books

So far, I've been reading the following books.

- [The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas](http://riscvbook.com/) [@pattersonRISCVReaderOpen2017] (2017) by David Patterson (RISC-V Foundation, Google, Berkeley), Andrew Waterman (SiFive). This is a relatively brief but dense introduction to the ISA, with a nicely organized visual representation of all instructions in just half a page!
- [RISC-V Assembly Language Programming: using ESP32-C3 and QEMU](https://www.elektor.com/products/risc-v-assembly-language-programming-using-esp32-c3-and-qemu) [@warrengayRISCVAssemblyLanguage2022] (2022) by Warren Gay is a hands-on, slow-paced, journey of the RV32/64 instructions through examples that you can run immediately on your computer (QEMU) or on real RICV-V silicon (ESP32-C3).
