# O-RISC-V

O-RISC-V is short for "Only RISC-V," a website where I collect RISC-V resources, with a focus on security aspects. I decided to embark on a journey to learn RISC-V and creating this website to collect references is my first step. As I read and experiment, I plan to provide summaries and create concise hands-on tutorials.
